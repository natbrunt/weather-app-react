##  Hi everyone

This app is ready for further developments.
I got the API keys for Google Auto Complete and Open weather working.

## What needs to be improved?

When giving New York City, NY, USA directly to Open weather, it has issues locating which city.
The reason this is an issue is because if we give it Paris, it will default to Paris, France,
even though there are several cities named Paris.

To further enhance the efficency of this app, Open Weather should probably be configured 
to just being fed longitude and latitude coords.
